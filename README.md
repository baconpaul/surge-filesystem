# Surge Filesystem

This is a library which allows you to use std::filesystem like things even on compilers 
that dont' fully support it or have different names. It's how we use fs:: in surge portably.

This is a submodule which is not currently consumed by surge but has a copy as of 1.8.

This documentation could obvioulsy be expanded with usage and will be one day soon.
